# reddit-video-autogen
This Python application automatically generates short form videos by scraping any subreddit for the N'th post, converting the text to speech using Google TTS, then automatically editing together preselected clips randomly and applying the title text and body text to the video.


## Usage
```
python3 shortFormScraper.py <subreddit name> <top post number to fetch>
```
